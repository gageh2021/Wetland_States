# Wetland_States
## Full_RS_data ##
Full_RS_data: Contains digitization information and summary statistics of remote sensing indices for each individaul wetland in the study area.
### Variables:
>OID - Object ID of wetland boundary polygon (0-117)  
>State - Wetland state classification (A-E)  
>Area_m - Wetland area in square kilometers  
>Area_km - Wetland area in square kilometers  
>Area_proportion - Proportion of total digitized area occupied by wetland  
>Pixel_count - Number of Sentinel-2 pixels inside the wetland  
>Pixel_area - Total area of Sentinel-2 pixels inside the wetland  
>RdNBR_min - Minimum Sentinel-2 RdNBR in wetland  
>RdNBR_max - Maximum Sentinel-2 RdNBR in wetland  
>RdNBR_mean - Mean Sentinel-2 RdNBR in wetland  
>RdNBR_SD - Standard deviation of Sentinel-2 RdNBR in wetland  
>NDWI_min - Minimum PlanetScope NDWI in wetland  
>NDWI_max - Maximum PlanetScope NDWI in wetland  
>NDWI_mean - Mean PlanetScope NDWI in wetland  
>NDWI_SD - Standard deviation of PlanetScope NDWI in wetland  

## Proportion_data ##
Proportion_data: Contains summary statistics for wetland states. 

### Variables:
>State - Wetland state classification (A-E)  
>Number - Total count of wetlands for a particular state  
>Relative_Proportion - Relative frequency of wetland state  
>Total_Area_km - Total area occupied by wetland state in square kilometers  
>Area_Proportion_km - Proportion of total area occupied by wetland state
